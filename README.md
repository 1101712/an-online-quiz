### Languages used
- [HTML5](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/)
### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs used

1. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Sans)
- The "Google fonts" tool was used to impoirt the fonts into the style.css file, which is used in this project.
2. [PT Font Family](https://company.paratype.com/pt-sans-pt-serif)
- The fonts from the PT Family were chosed to make the website futureproof. As already mentioned, I
plan on adding multilanguage support to this project, and the Paratype fonts are built around non-latin
characters, such as the Cyrillic alphabet and special charachters used in post-Soviet countries, which
are very rare to find in fonts produced in the anglophone world. While dealing with an impressive amount
of letters from different language families, the PT font never compromises on aestetics - it has been
created by the internationally acclaimed typeface designer [Alexandra Korolkova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Korolkova) and Olga Umpelova.
However, should the project grow big enough to be translated into east-Asian or south-Asian languages,
new fonts shall be added to support, for example, Japanese or Thai fonts.
